see instead:

[nixCats-nvim](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim)

Which is also not a distribution, but rather the package manager this neovim config uses.

You can run it with `nix shell github:BirdeeHub/birdeeSystems#nvim_for_u` and then typing `vi`, `vim`, `nvim`, or `nvim_for_u`.

This is not a distro, its the graveyard of plugins I might have never fully set up.

If something is broken get your own config.

While I would not suggest using my config, I definitely have a lot of stuff in it and it works for what I need it for.

[`lze`](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/lze) keeps it loading fast despite my plugin addiction!

It uses [`lze`](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/lze) for lazy loading, which has a very similar plugin spec to [`lz.n`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lz.n).

`lze` is my take on what `lz.n` did.
