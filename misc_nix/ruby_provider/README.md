You really don't need to do this, but if I use the feature I find out if it breaks.

It is just an updated version of [this directory from nixpkgs.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/74ad6cb1d2b14edb4ad1fffc0791e94910c61453/pkgs/applications/editors/neovim/ruby_provider)

If you don't provide it, it will grab it from there.

This is not an overlay, it's just in here to keep it out of the way.

Path to this file is provided to gem_path setting in packageDefinitions.

To update it when required, cd here and then run:

nix run --no-write-lock-file github:BirdeeHub/neovim_ruby_updater
